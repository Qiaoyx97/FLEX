## Description
In this work we present FLEX，a multi-modal fusion model that integrates clinical data, proteomic data, metabolomic data, and pathology images across different scales and modalities, with a focus on advanced feature learning and representation. FLEX contains a Feature Encoding Trainer structure that can train feature encoding, thus achieving fusion of inter-feature and inter-modal.
